Computer coding is an essential requirement in any branch of science and technology. Knowledge of coding helps one 
to simulate any physical phenomena with a scope of better understanding of the system. In teaching learning process, 
simulation and hence, computer coding plays a very significant role. One can do coding in any language. 
But, Python happens to be the most easy tool as programming language for implementing coding. 
Moreover, it is an open source software and can be worked from any platform. 

In this section, I shall share some of the coding which can be easily implemented with minimum knowledge of pogramming.

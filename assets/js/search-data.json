            "title": "A Numerical Approach to Solve Ordinary Differential equation (ODE)",
            "content": "Differential equation is perhaps one such mathematical entity which we maximum encounter in any branch of science and technology and without solving it we can not get insight of the system. That is why a robust knowledge of solving differential equation is very much desireable and hence, it is included in the curriculum of undergraduate syllabus of any science discipline. Analytical method of solving differential equation is quite straight forward. But it too fail to crack the problem if it is of complex nature. . In that case, numerical technique plays a signifivant role which can solve the problem in its own way. That is why along with the technique of analytical methodlogy theknowledge of numerical technique of solving differential equation is highly desired. . In this section, a few numerical technique will be discussed. The most simple, may be the first stepping stone in the pursuit of solving differential equation is the Euler&#39;s method. . Consider the following ODE $$ frac{dy}{dx}= frac{y+x}{y-x}, hspace{0.5cm}y(0)=1 $$ Let us find the value $y$ at $x=0.6$, taking the step size = 0.2. . import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt . So, first of all discretize the domain of independent variable either by arange or linspace function of NumPy. . x_init, x_final, step_size = 0, 0.6, 0.2 x = np.arange(x_init, x_final+step_size, step_size) . Next, we have to create arrays for storing the values of dependent variable. Since, we are trying to visualize the difference between different methods of solving differential equation, we have to create array for each method. . y = np.zeros(len(x)) # array for Euler method y_mod = np.zeros(len(x)) # array for Modified Euler method y_rk2 = np.zeros(len(x)) # array for RK2 method y_rk4 = np.zeros(len(x)) # array for RK4 method y_odeint = np.zeros(len(x)) # array for odeint method # Initialize your variables y[0] = 1 y_mod[0] = 1 y_rk2[0] = 1 y_rk4[0] = 1 y_odeint[0] = 1 . Next, we have to define a few helper functions. Since, the most essential part of solving differential equation is to estimate the value of slope at the desired point/points, so, we have to define a function which we may call model. So, the model function in our problem is given by . f = lambda y, x: (y+x)/(y-x) #Slope function def model(y, x): slope = f(y, x) # f(x,y) may be repleced by appropriate value according to the problem return slope . In the above representation of function definition, one may simply stick to model function. The additional f function for better clarity, keeping in mind a new learner. . Consider, the differential equation $$ frac{dy}{dx}=f(x,y(x))$$ . The idea of solving a differential equation numerically is to evaluate any future value of the dependent variable $y$ with the known value of independnt varibale $x$, known value of slope, and step-size of the interval, i.e. $$ text{y_new} = y + text{slope} times text{step-size}$$ . Suppose, the value of the dependent variable $y_i$ is known at $x_i$ and we want to know the corresponding value at $x_{i+1}$ which is at a distance $h$ apart from $x_i$, then, $$y_{i+1}=y_i + frac{dy}{dx} Bigr|_{(x_i,y_i)} cdot h$$ . where, $ frac{dy}{dx} Bigr|_{(x_i,y_i)}=f(x_i, y(x_i))$ is known at the point $(x_i, y_i)$. But, the accuracy of the method lies in the value of step-size (h). So, we can define a function eulerFunc for evaluating the values of dependent variable $y$ corresponding to the values of dependent variable $x$. . . def eulerFunc(y, x, h): y_new = y + model(y, x)*h return y_new . The success of Euler&#39;s method which depends heavily on small stepsize ($h$) may amount to long time of evalaution. This limitation may, however, be overcome by evaluating the slopes of the function at $x_i$ and $x_{i+1}$, and then taking an average of both for calculating the future value at $x_{i+1}$. This is implemented with the following function. . . def eulerModFunc(y, x, h): k1 = model(y, x) # slope at (x, y) y_p = y + k1*h # predicted &#39;y&#39; value at &#39;x+h&#39; based on &#39;k1&#39; k2 = model(y_p, x+h) # slope at (x+h, y+h) k_avg = (k1+k2)/2 # average of the slopes at &#39;k1&#39; and &#39;k2&#39; y_c = y + k_avg*h # corrected &#39;y&#39; value at &#39;x+h&#39; based on &#39;k_avg&#39; return y_c . Runge Kutta method of second order follows an intermediate path between previous two methods. Here, we first evaluate slope $k_1$ at $x_i$ and then $k_2$ at $x_{i+ frac{h}{2}}$ with the slope value $k_1$ evaluated at $x_i$. This slope $k_2$ is used to evaluate $y_{i+1}$. We define following function for its implementation. . . def rk2Func(y, x, h): k1 = model(y, x) k2 = model(y+k1*h/2, x+h/2) y_new = y + k2*h return y_new . In the Runge Kutta method of order four, average of slope values evaluated at four different points within the interval $(x_i, x_{i+1})$ is used to calculate $y_{i+1}$ with the known values of $y_i$ at $x_i$. . . def rk4Func(y, x, h): k1 = model(y, x) k2 = model(y+k1*h/2, x+h/2) k3 = model(y+k2*h/2, x+h/2) k4 = model(y+k3*h, x+h) k_avg = (k1+2*(k2+k3)+k4)/6 y_new = y + k_avg*h return y_new . h = step_size for i in range(len(x)-1): y[i+1] = eulerFunc(y[i], x[i], h) y_mod[i+1] = eulerModFunc(y_mod[i], x[i], h) y_rk2[i+1] = rk2Func(y_rk2[i], x[i], h) y_rk4[i+1] = rk4Func(y_rk2[i], x[i], h) x, y, y_mod, y_rk2, y_rk4 .

Besides the above mentioned numerical methods, where writing a few lines of coding is required on the part of the user, there is a function called odeint under SciPy package which can directly solve a differential equation. . from scipy.integrate import odeint y0 = y[0] sol = odeint(model, y0, x) y_odeint = sol[:, 0] y_odeint . array([1. , 1.23923039, 1.54891242, 1.91148762]) . plt.figure(figsize=(10,5)) plt.plot(x, y, ls = &#39;:&#39;, marker=&#39;^&#39;, markersize=10, color=&#39;red&#39;, label=&#39;Euler method&#39;) plt.plot(x, y_mod, ls = &#39;:&#39;, marker=&#39;*&#39;, markersize=10, color=&#39;blue&#39;, label=&#39;ModifiedEuler method&#39;) plt.plot(x, y_rk2, ls = &#39;:&#39;, marker=&#39;o&#39;, markersize=10, color=&#39;green&#39;, label=&#39;RK2 method&#39;) plt.plot(x, y_rk4, ls = &#39;:&#39;, marker=&#39;&lt;&#39;, markersize=10, color=&#39;orange&#39;, label=&#39;RK4 method&#39;) plt.plot(x, y_odeint, ls = &#39;:&#39;, marker=&#39;^&#39;, markersize=10, color=&#39;purple&#39;, label=&#39;odeint method&#39;) plt.xlabel(&#39;x&#39;, fontsize=14) plt.ylabel(&#39;y(x)&#39;, fontsize=14) plt.title(&#39;Comaparison of Euler, Modified Euler, RK2, RK4 and odeint Method&#39;, fontsize=16) plt.legend(frameon=False, loc=&#39;best&#39;) plt.show() .

In this section, I am going to simulate another kind of projectile motion cosidering effect of air resistance. Consider a cannonball fired towards a target with a certain velocity, say $100 m/s$. Suppose, the target is at a distance 100 kilometer from the cannon. What should be the angle of fire so that cannonball hits the target accurately? Consider, the air resistance to be approximately 0.01. . The projectile motion is influenced by force of gravity and drag force due to air resistance. The equation of motion - . For motion in horizontal direction | $$ frac{d^2x}{dt^2}=-kv_x$$ . For motion in vertical direction $$ frac{d^2y}{dt^2}=-g -kv_y$$ | For numerically solving the differential equations, let us split them into two first order differential equations. . $$ frac{dx}{dt}=v_x $$ $$ frac{dv_x}{dt}=-kv_x$$ $$ frac{dy}{dt}=v_y $$ $$ frac{dv_y}{dt}=-g-kv_y$$ .

            "content": "The most common physical phenomenon in our day to day life is the motion of an object in air. It may be observed in any game or similar other activities. We may observe an object moving up in air and coming down due to gravity or it may be thrown in air making an angle with horizontal in which case it travels in air for some time and finally, falls on the ground. We may simulate the motion in computer with the knowledge of basic numerical methods and coding. This helps in understanding and viewing the effect of various physical parameters like angle of projection or air resistance etc. on the prjectile motion. . In this section, I shall demonstrate the simulation of a simple vertical motion of a projectile without considering air resistance. Consider throwing a projectile vertically in the upward direction and expect it to come back and hit the ground after ten second. The motion of the projectile can be described by $$ frac{d^2 y}{dt^2} = -g, hspace{0.5cm}y(0)=0 $$ Here, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity. This is a second order differential equation. To solve this type equation, we need two initial conditions - initial position and initial velocity. If we know the initial position and if we do not have prior knowledge of initial velocity which together progress the simulation, then we can apply a numerical technique, called &quot;shooting method&quot; to obtain correct value of velocity. So, for simulating this projectile motion, we have to do basically two operations. . Solving the differential equation. | Estimating correct initial velocity of projection by &quot;shooting method&quot;. | The differential equation can be solved by any standard method like Euler method or Runge Kutta method. But, we can make use of SciPy package to solve this initial value problem to save time and space. . First of all, we shall import necessary library packages like numpy for creating arrays, SciPy package for solving initial value problem and matplotlib for graphical demonstration of the simulation. . import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt from scipy.integrate import solve_ivp . To solve the second order differential equation numerically, we have to split up into two first order differential equations. $$ frac{dy}{dt} = v frac{dv}{dt} = - g $$ . def plot(): fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 5)) # set the x-spine ax.spines[&#39;left&#39;].set_position(&#39;zero&#39;) # turn off the right spine/ticks ax.spines[&#39;right&#39;].set_color(&#39;none&#39;) ax.yaxis.tick_left() # set the y-spine ax.spines[&#39;bottom&#39;].set_position(&#39;zero&#39;) # turn off the top spine/ticks ax.spines[&#39;top&#39;].set_color(&#39;none&#39;) ax.xaxis.tick_bottom() . def model(t, z): y, v = z dy_dt = v dv_dt = - g dz_dt = [dy_dt, dv_dt] return dz_dt def yFunc(v): v0 = v t = np.linspace(0, 10, 100) t_span = (t[0], t[-1]) y0 = 0 y0 = [y0, v0] sol = solve_ivp(model, t_span, y0, t_eval=t) return sol plot() g = 9.8 v_guess = [35, 55, 75] color = [&#39;red&#39;, &#39;blue&#39;, &#39;green&#39;] for i in range(len(v_guess)): sol = yFunc(v_guess[i]) t = sol.t y = sol.y[0, :] plt.plot(t, y, ls=&#39;:&#39;, color=color[i], lw=3, label=&#39;v = %0.2f&#39;%v_guess[i]) plt.xlabel(&#39;$t$&#39;, fontsize=14) plt.ylabel(&#39;$y(t)$&#39;, fontsize=14) plt.axvline(x = 10, ls=&#39;--&#39;, color=&#39;black&#39;) plt.legend(loc=&#39;best&#39;) plt.show() . Since, we did not have have any prior knowledge of initial velocity, let us start with a guess value of it. It is seen that the solver function has simulated the projectile motion for three different guess values of initial velocities. But, it failed to arrive at the initial point after ten second. The value $v=55 m/s$ is little close to the level of expectation. Other two values are far away from the actual one. This means our guess on initial velocity is not correct. So, we try the simulation with a range of initial velocities. . @np.vectorize def y(v0): t = np.linspace(0, 10, 100) t_span = (t[0], t[-1]) y0 = 0 y0 = [y0, v0] sol = solve_ivp(model, t_span, y0, t_eval=t) t = sol.t y, v = sol.y return y[-1] v0 = np.linspace(0, 100, 100) plot() plt.plot(v0, y(v0), &#39;b--&#39;) plt.xlabel(&#39;$v_{guess}$&#39;, fontsize=14) plt.ylabel(&#39;$y$&#39;, fontsize=14) plt.show() . So, we see that for the velocity around 50, the projectile exactly returns to the initial point. For finding the exact value, we can apply bisection method to loacte the root. We can use SciPy package to apply bisection method. . from scipy.optimize import bisect exact_velocity = bisect(y, 40, 60) print(&quot;Exact velocity = %0.2f&quot;%exact_velocity) . Exact velocity = 49.00 . So, if we throw the projectile with an initial velocity 49 m/s, it will come back exactly after 10 sec. to the initial point. The way to arrive at correct value of initial velocty is called &quot;shooting method&quot;. . In the next post, I shall come up with the case of inclined projectile, i.e. when the projectile is fired making some angle with the horizontal and also, consider the effect of air resistance on the projectile motion. .",

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | .
